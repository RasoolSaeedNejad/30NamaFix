# 30NamaFix
Bypass the download manager bug in the 30Nama application temporarily.

## Target:
The reason for writing this program is that the 30Nama program has just been released and has some bugs.

One of these bugs is that the in-app download manager process actually closes completely and the download stops. But the user is not notified. And the user comes to the download after hours and sees that the download has been stopped and he has just lost his time. And it takes a long time to download.

The program alerts the user with a warning message whenever it encounters this problem. Until the user closes and reopens the 30Nama application and continues to download and save time.

## How to Use:
* To run the program, just run the `30NamaFix.exe` file,
**But** before that you have to run the [30Nama](https://30Nama.com) program.
* If you are using the source, just run the `30NamaFix.bat` file to run it.

## The software I used to convert the script file to an executable file:

* [BAT to EXE](https://soft98.ir/software/2579-bat-to-exe-converter.html): I used this program to convert Batch File (`bat`) to Executable File (`exe`).
* [VBSEdit](https://www.vbsedit.com/): I also used this program to convert Visual Basic Scripts (`vbs`) to Executable Files (`exe`).
* [Advanced Installer](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/): I used this program to create a Setup Installer. In the [Release section](https://github.com/RasoolSaeedNejad/30NamaFix/releases), you can download Setup.
